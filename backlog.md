To-do
-----
* Take reaching column 0 and 9 into account.
* Add task to copy release output to genetics directory.

Done
----
* 2015-11-07] Remove not required left-right's.

Not done
--------
* [2015-11-06] Add spawn row to blocks and add to evaluation.
  - It's slows down the evaluation, but will not help in prevent it from
    happening as, it is detected easily in an early stage by other checks already.
